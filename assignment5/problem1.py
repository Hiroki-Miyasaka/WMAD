#Design and implement a function which takes 2 operands (numbers) and one operator 
#(plus, minus, multiplication and division) and applies the operator on the operands and 
#returns and prints the result. 
#Note: If operand1 is a non-zero number and the operand2 is zero, then the program 
#should not perform the division operand and should print the operation is not possible 
#because one number is zero (this is only for division operator) and return -1. 
n = int(input("Please input number1: "))
n2 = int(input("Please input number2: "))
operator = input("Please input operator: ")

  if(operator == "*"):
    result = n * n2

  elif(operator == "+"):
    result = n + n2
